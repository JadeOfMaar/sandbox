# USI Entine Tuner
Recalibrates engines from some USI mods.

## Alcubiere
Provides an easy thing for rebalancing the warp drives to meet your needs. Includes resizing the warp bubble (with a tax on ExoticMatter), increasing Isp for better fuel economy, and slowing down the ExoticMatter producer if you'd rather that not draw insane amounts of EC and possibly brick the ship when running.

## Karbonite Plus
Fixes the atmosphere curves of the Karborundum engines but also adjusts their thrust, improves Isp, raises EC demand, and makes the "fusion" drives actually have far higher Isp and modestly lower thrust than the "torch" drives.
